## :question: What's the blackout all about? 

In protest against Article 13 (uploadfilters) and Article 11 (link tax) of the currently much discussed copyright directive, we encourage you to display nothing but a blackout page on the 21st of March. Even the german wikipedia will display a blackout page!

## :wrench: How do I use it?

You can either use the versions inside the repository here and upload it your server, or use this snippet here and include it in the `<head>` section of your website:

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://static.savetheinternet.info/js/blackout.min.js"></script>
```

**Note:** If you use wordpress, you can use our plugin: https://github.com/savetheinternetinfo/sti-blackout-wordpress
